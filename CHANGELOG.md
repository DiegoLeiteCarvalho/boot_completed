## 0.1.1

changed implementation of boot completed receiver
back to the way that uses a method channel
since it seems like hardcoding the dart function name
only works in debug builds - with release builds, it's no longer functional

## 0.1.0+3

revised readmes a bit more, added link to github repo in pubspec
added dartdoc comment
confirmed compatibility with path_provider 1.0.0, changed dependency to ">=0.5.0+1 <2.0.0"

## 0.1.0+2

change http url to https

## 0.1.0+1

pub.dev analysis now finds the description is too long - shortened it

## 0.1.0

Update version number and a few non-functional things suggested by pub.dev analysis.

## 0.0.1

Initial version with working example.
